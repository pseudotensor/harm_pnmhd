Comparison, affectin dot's and dynamics:
1) Rin changing:
   n17 vs n16 vs n25
   n28 vs f9 (show how similar)
   f2 vs f4 (show how sim and how diff)
   (f11) vs f3 vs f6
   n7 vs f8
   a1 vs a2
   a3 vs a4 (a4 not going yet)
   n7 vs (n12) vs n11 vs n10

   n1 vs n23 (res changes too) (how similar)
2) Rout/Rinj changing
   n31 vs n32
3) Rinj changing
   n16 vs f2 vs f5 (how different)
   f16 vs f18
   n31 vs g3 (bug MG->IGUR)
   f3 vs f7
   f10 vs a1
   tori: n38 vs n40
4) u_inj changing
5) perscription changing:
   n28 vs n16 (contour plot of polar eddies)
   f8 vs f10
   tori: n23 vs n27
6) Resolution
   n16 vs n28 vs n30
   tori: n1 vs n23 (and 2rg->1.4rg) (how similar)
   o7 vs o10
   n37 vs n38
7) gamma
   n25 vs n26
   f13 vs f14 vs f12 (3/2,4/3,5/3)
8) alpha
   f18, g1, g2, g4, (f7)
   f14, f15
   n7 vs n6
9) Like IGU runs/results
   n7, f13, f14, f12, f15
   (f3,f6,f7 for alpha=0.1 gam=5/3) Model G
   (n10, (n13, n7,n12, n11, n10) for alpha=0.1,gam=3/2) Model H
   (f2, (n8,n17), n16, n28, n30) for Model M
   n6
10) PW vs Newt
    f11 vs f12 at 3rg
    o10 vs n1 at 2rg (o10 scaled)
11) tori vs inj
    n16 vs n37 (but Rinj/Rout changes)

conclusions: Rin changes Edot/Mdot alot, Mdot a bit, even for similar looking flow

Question convergence of all rates, flow properties, etc.

Gammie todo:
1) Rin
2) Torus vs Injection
3) uni polar outflows on viscosity(stress) prescription.
4) injection entropy/Rout dependency

Theory: related to bondi
-------
gam=5/3 is unstable for a certain heated fluid, bi-lobe forms, etc.

other gams are not unstable, won't show unioutflow.

Rout does control how much heating can occur, and 20rg is much diff than 200rg, with gam=5/3 at least.

resolution introduces pole death only for Rout large enough.  Again, Rout matters in heating things enough so activity takes place to cause PD.  possible other gam!=5/3 has no PD, so may be an unstable thing again.

gam=5/3 with enough heating seems to causing PD and related wave stuff, need to see if other gam!=5/3 has no wave stuff at alpha=0.01.

----------
bondi with larger Be to see how heating affects bondi(Mdot).
do IGU-like run with hotter heating

g6: do hotter injection at lower radius to see if goes outflow

Check bondi for the billionth time(email says gam=5/3 ok with R<1/4!  Just not long enough run time?


Problems:
1) P: double makes diff ,  Q: where's the fault in using floats?
a) 

2) P: hotter injection makes diff, Rout/Rinj makes diff.   Q: how different?
3) P: gam=5/3,3/2,4/3 vs alpha, unipolar outflow, general convection, Rin. Q: Does Rin really matter for Rinj out far enough?
4) P: Resolution makes diff, Q: Why, how, and what resolution is good enough?
5) P: Pole death at high res when Rout large enough Q: Why happens, can "fix"?
6) P: Bondi unstable Q: what pararms, why?  how long till for given params(res, rin, n1, etc.)
TODO:

1) Paper, references on little items, and big ones too
2) comps:
a) as in problems
